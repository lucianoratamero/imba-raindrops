# imba-raindrops

this is a small proof of concept, meant for studying [imba](http://imba.io/) and discovering artistic value with web components

the generated site is on [my personal site](http://www.ratamero.com/imba-raindrops/), which runs on github pages (based on the dist folder)

if you have any questions, just open an issue and I'll answer it when I can :)

## Getting started

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
# start webpack-dev-server and compiler
npm run dev
# build to the dist folder
npm run build
# or deploy it to github pages
npm run deploy
```

## For the no-canvas version

install [animejs](https://animejs.com/) with `npm install animejs`
